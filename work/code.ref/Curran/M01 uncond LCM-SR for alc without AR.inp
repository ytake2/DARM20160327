title:
 univariate linear LCM-SR for alcohol use NOT including regressions among the residuals
 presented in the 1st & 2nd paragraphs of the 1st column on page 889
 this model has phantom variables defined but are not needed here. this only sets up
 the ability to estimate regressions among the residuals in later models
data: 
 file=currandemo.dat;
variable: 
 names=id gen trt alc1-alc5 dep1-dep5;
 usevar=alc1-alc5;
analysis: 
 estimator=ml;
 model=nocovariances; ! supresses default estimation of certain covs in model;
model:
 alcint alcslp | alc1@0 alc2@1 alc3@2 alc4@3 alc5@4; ! linear growth in alc;

 alcint with alcslp; ! freeing factor covs because of "nocovariances" option earlier;

 alcres1 by alc1@1; ! create "phantom factors" to define the time-specific residuals;
 alcres2 by alc2@1; ! for the SR-part of model. This is simply a programming trick so;
 alcres3 by alc3@1; ! we can use the residuals as predictor and outcome variables;
 alcres4 by alc4@1; ! these are not necessary in this model but allow for more;
 alcres5 by alc5@1; ! complex models later;

 [alc1-alc5@0]; alc1-alc5@0; ! fixing means & vars of manfiest repeated measures to 0; 
 [alcres1-alcres5@0];        ! fixing mean of resids to zero for identification;
  alcres1-alcres5;           ! estimating variances of residuals;

output: 
 standardized;
