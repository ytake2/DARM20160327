title:
 bivariate LCM-SR for alcohol use and depression that includes within-construct
 residual auto-regressions but not across-construct time-lagged residual regressions. 
 presented in the 1st full paragraph of the 1st column on page 890

analysis: 
 estimator=ml;
 model=nocovariances; ! supresses default estimation of certain covs in model;
model:
 alcint alcslp | alc1@0 alc2@1 alc3@2 alc4@3 alc5@4; ! linear growth in alc;

 alcint with depint;

 alcres1 by alc1@1; ! create "phantom factors" to define the time-specific residuals;
 alcres2 by alc2@1; ! for the SR-part of model. This is simply a programming trick so;
